=== A demo app for dynamically generating a hierarchical listing from tagged entries, using tag counts

The important bits: {/app/models/entry.rb}[https://github.com/foucist/tag-tree/blob/master/app/models/entry.rb]  
& {/app/helpers/entries_helper.rb}[https://github.com/foucist/tag-tree/blob/master/app/helpers/entries_helper.rb]

=== Potential future improvement:

Even though it's idiomatic rails, the code organization seems awkward due to the heavy view logic that's required (currently in the helper).  The next step is to start using a View object (or Presenter).
